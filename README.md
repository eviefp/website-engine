# TODO

This PR:
- [x] go back and rewrite history removing pointless debugging things
- [x] keep verbose output but move some stuff to info and change the default to be info
- [x] add some tests around the wikilinks stuff
- [x] how do I not copy/paste the haskellPackages? do I just have a separate nix file defining haskellPackages?
- [ ] move over things to website

- RSS helpers?
- use https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake-plus-0.3.4.0/docs/Development-Shake-Plus-Core.html#t:RAction
- look into https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake-minify
- maybe remove Slick? not using much anymore
- consider more newtypes, especially around `Text` and/or `Item` fields
