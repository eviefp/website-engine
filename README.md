# TODO

- Links should work like [[module:id]] (which gets substituted by title) or [[module:id|foo]]; [[id]] means "current module"
- RSS helpers?
- use https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake-plus-0.3.4.0/docs/Development-Shake-Plus-Core.html#t:RAction
- look into https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake-minify
